🧩 NFT Gallery Component Modularity: Solo Builder Guide
1. Best Practices for Modularity & Repairability
One Feature, One File:
Keep individual components—Navbar, Sidebar, NFTCard, NFTTabs, etc.—in separate .tsx files.
Props-Driven:
UI components receive all their data via props, not direct global state access.
Strict Data/UI Separation:
Put ALL data fetching/filtering in hooks or providers (e.g. /hooks/useAuctionNFTs.ts, /providers/AuctionNFTProvider.tsx). Components just render props.
No Hardcoded Theme Values:
Corner radius, colors, etc., are always set via CSS variables and Tailwind/shadcn config. Update theme in one place to affect all components.
Low Coupling:
Components only import direct "parents/children"—never reach across unrelated modules.
Test & Repair Friendly:
You can safely edit, replace, or debug one component at a time without breaking the site—if isolation is maintained.
Single Responsibility:
If a file grows or does too many things, split it for clarity.
2. Visual Overview (Component Relationship)
Provider/hooks → supply pure data to all UI

(Provider/Hook Layer) ↓ ┌───────────────┐ │ Navbar │ │ Sidebar │ │ NFTTabs │ └─────┬─┬──┬────┘ │ │ │ NFTGrid │ NFTCard

Changing NFTCard (style/logic) does NOT break grid/sidebar/nav.

All state/theme logic is centralized and reusable.

3. In Practice
Want to restyle NFTCard? Edit /components/Grid/NFTCard.tsx only.
Fix a search bug? Tweak /hooks/useAuctionNFTs.ts.
Sidebar filter changes? Only touch /components/Layout/Sidebar.tsx.
You can comment/unplug any UI module and the rest stays functional.

Bottom line:
This structure makes solo work safe, flexible, and quick to adjust or debug.
